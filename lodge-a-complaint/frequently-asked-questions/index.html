				<p>It is not compulsory for you to complain first to your insurance company before submitting a complaint to OSTI. This means that OSTI will consider your complaint even if you have not yet complained to your insurer. However, we do suggest that, before submitting a complaint to OSTI you first try to resolve your issue with your insurer. We give this advice because –</p>
<ul>
<li>It is helpful if the insurer has the chance to look into any complaint, before the ombudsman steps in so that it can make sure it has made the right decision.</li>
<li>Many complaints are caused by a misunderstanding, either on your part or on the part of your insurer. These types of complaints can be quickly and easily fixed once the problem is understood.</li>
<li>When you complain to the insurer, your claim will usually be looked at by a different person at the insurer. This means that you will get a second opinion from the insurer and you may have your issue resolved.</li>
<li>Even if your issue is not resolved by the insurer, submitting a complaint to the insurer may give you more information about your matter which will assist you in making your complaint to OSTI.</li>

<li>It is usually best to complain in writing. But if you phone, ask for the name of the person you speak to. Keep a note of this information, with details such as, the date and time of your call and what was said. This may be required at a later stage.</li>
<li>Remain calm and polite, however emotional, angry or upset you may be. You are more likely to explain your complaint clearly and effectively if you can stay calm.</li>
<li>Initially attempt contacting the person you originally dealt with. If they cannot help, indicate that the matter will be taken further. Seek details of the name or job title of the person who will be handling your complaint and for details of the Insurer's complaints procedure.</li>
<li>Attempt taking up the matter with a senior official at the insurer.</li>
<li>When you write a letter of complaint, set out the facts as clearly as possible.</li>
<li>Write down the facts in a logical order and stick to what is relevant. Include important details like your claim number or your policy number.</li>
<li>Keep a copy of any letters between you and the Insurer.</li>
</ol>
<p>  </p>
<p>What to do next:</p>
<p>If you are not happy with the Insurer's decision you may:</p>
<p>    </p>
<ol>
<li>Contact us. We may be able to help. You will need to fill in a complaint form and send it back to us; or</li>
<li>Issue a summons against the insurance company out of the Small Claims Court (there is a small cost involved). There is maximum amount that can be claimed in the Small Claims Court. This amount is amended from time to time by declaration in the Government Gazette by the Minister in the justice ministry; or</li>
<li>Consult with an attorney to pursue the matter by means of further legal action.</li>

				<p>No, all we need from you are the documents that are relevant to your side of the story and any other information that you may have that will help us to deal with your complaint. We decide if the insurer has handled your matter properly by looking at the facts of the case – not at how well you present your arguments. We prefer to hear from you in your own words. Our services are free and informal and we are not a court.</p>
<p>That does not mean you do not have the right to use someone else’s services to act on your behalf. Some people use friends, relatives, lawyers or brokers to help them with their complaints. If you do use someone else to help you, you will need to fill in a <strong><u>power of attorney</u></strong> and send this to us. If you do decide to appoint a specialist or an attorney you will have to pay their costs yourself.

		<div id="collapse13" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>We look at each complaint carefully. There is no set time in which we resolve complaints. Each matter is different and how long it takes will depend on a number of things including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How complex the complaint is;</li>
<li>How long it takes to get all the relevant information and for both sides to tell their story;</li>
<li>Whether reports from third parties (such as loss adjusters or claims experts) are needed;</li>
<li>Whether you or the insurer accept our initial recommendation.</li>

<p>Some complaints can be resolved in a few weeks. About 50% of complaints submitted to OSTI are resolved within four months. Only 3% of complaints take longer than nine months to resolve.</p>
<p>We publish detailed figures showing how long it takes us to resolve complaints each year in our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://osti.co.za/news-room/#reports">annual report</a>.</strong></span>  </p>

				<p>Once we receive your <a href="../index.html"><strong><u>application for assistance</u></strong></a> we will consider it to make sure –</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains all the <strong><u>relevant information</u></strong>;</li>
<li>Your complaint falls within our <strong><u>jurisdiction</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once satisfied we will allocate a reference number to you. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU USE THIS REFERENCE NUMBER WHENEVER YOU COMMUNICATE WITH US.</p>
<p>Once your complaint has been registered we will send it to the insurer. The insurer will be given 14 days from the date that it receives your complaint from us to try to resolve the matter with you.</p>
<p>If the matter is not resolved <strong>to your satisfaction </strong>during this period, the insurer will then submit a formal answer to us stating why it does not agree with your complaint.</p>
<p>We will send this response to you and we will either give you our initial view on the outcome of the matter or, if we still need more information, simply ask you to give us your response to the insurer’s answer to your complaint.</p>
<p>At this stage there is often a delay as we may need time to consider the information that has been given to us and we may also need to ask for more information.</p>
<p>Once we have all the information we need we may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a <strong><u>recommendation</u></strong> suggesting the outcome of the complaint;</li>
<li>Decide that there are too many <strong><u>factual disputes</u></strong> to be resolved and that we are not able to help you any further.</li>

		<div id="collapse15" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>We look at the individual circumstances of each case. Our recommendations are based on the law and, where appropriate, on what we believe is fair and reasonable. When deciding a complaint we consider all the relevant facts and arguments. The outcome will be based on the version of events that seems the more likely or probable. This is called deciding on a “balance of probability” and refers to the standard test to be used when deciding civil (as opposed to criminal) disputes.</p>
<p>We will always ask both you and the insurer for your views. We will also give each side a chance to comment on what the other side has said. If we need specific information from you or the insurer in order to assist us in deciding the case we will ask for it. Only once we have gathered all the necessary information will we make a decision. We do not have the power to hold hearings or allow witnesses to testify. All of the information must be provided to us electronically or in writing.</p>
<p>A decision is binding on the insurer and the insurer cannot withdraw from our complaints process unless you choose to do so.</p>

				<p>OSTI is independent and impartial. This means that it is neither a consumer champion nor an industry trade-body. If we believe that the insurer has made a mistake, or that your issue was unfairly handled by the insurer, we will say so. If, however, we do not find fault with the way in which the insurer has dealt with your matter, we will find in favour of the insurer. Our approach to a matter is much the same as that of a judge in court – we consider the facts of your matter and make a decision based on the law and, where appropriate, on considerations of fairness and equity.</p>

		<div id="collapse18" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>No. OSTI’s purpose is to deal with individual complaints between insurers and consumers and to put things right where there has been an error or mistake. This may mean that we tell an insurer to pay a claim or remove an excess fee or amount that has been charged to the consumer. But we do not make rules for insurers or impose fines or punishments if we believe they have done something wrong. We do not monitor the way they do business or make sure that they are complying with the law. That is a job for the Regulator (The Financial Sector Conduct Authority).</p>

The Regulator will then decide on the best way to deal with the issue.</p>

<p>If you are not happy with OSTI’s decision, your rights are not at all affected. You are not bound by our decisions. You are still free to look for other ways to continue to challenge the insurer’s decision. You can see a lawyer, go to court or pursue other forms of dispute resolution such as arbitration.</p>

				<p>OSTI will usually, but not always, provide both sides with all of the information given to it. There may be some instances where a party asks OSTI to keep certain information confidential. This could be because the information is, for example, –</p>
<ul>
<li>A legal opinion obtained for the purposes of litigation;</li>
<li>A confidential investigation report dealing with wider issues than the complaint – for example, an investigation into fraudulent conduct;</li>
<li>Revealing the information may place a person at risk.</li>

		<div id="collapse24" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>OSTI receives around 15 000 complaints each year and investigates around 10 000 of those. If OSTI was required to hold a hearing in respect of even half of these matters it would be unable to provide the assistance to complainants and the industry that it currently does. Instead OSTI provides an informal alternative to civil court. We cannot compel witnesses to attend hearings and give evidence.</p>
<p>We also do not have the power to compel witnesses to take an oath or affirmation or to subject themselves to cross examination. Our process is entirely different from that of a court where two lawyers will argue a matter and present evidence to a judge who will then make a decision. Instead, OSTI will act in an inquisitorial manner and will ask questions and for information. OSTI is not restricted to the issues set out in the complaint.</p>
<p>It can go further if necessary and request additional information. OSTI is required by law to resolve matters fairly. This means that it can decide how a matter should proceed and ask questions to ensure that it gets to the bottom of the issue. This means that we are not persuaded by the best legal argument but instead focus on the actual facts of the complaint.</p>
<p>We try to achieve an informal resolution of the matter as soon as it is possible. In many instances we are able to resolve matters to the satisfaction of both sides by making informal recommendations and without having to issue formal ombudsman decisions.</p>
